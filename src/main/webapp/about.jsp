		<h1>What is CrowdTrust?</h1>
<p>Let’s say that I have a 100 photos of birds, and I want to know which birds are robins, but I have
no prior knowledge of birds. Our product, CrowdTrust, focusses on providing a solution for this
problem.
Our product provides a framework for a user to submit a task and specify the level of accuracy
they want achieved in the task. At the moment, there is only one main competitor in the market,
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Our product aims to improve on Mechanical Turk by prioritising
responses from experts as well as dynamically deciding when a task is completed (based on the
responses and desired accuracy).
So how does our product tie in with the problem previously posed? CrowdTrust provides us with
the environment to upload the photos of birds and ask the question "Which of these are robins?",
specify the level of accuracy desired (say, with 95% certainty), and then the task is sent out to the
crowd. Once completed, a solution to the task as proposed by the crowd is returned, indicating
which birds are robins.</p>

<h1>Why now?</h1>
<p>Crowdsourcing is become more popular day by day. It allows a person who needs a job done, but
has no prior knowledge on the subject, to get a very accurate result through the contribution of
many people who might be experts on the subject of the task. Besides Mechanical Turk, there are
other websites which provide a specialised crowdsourcing frameworks, such at Stack Overflow. We
wanted to produce a framework which would not necessarily be specialised. The scope of problems
people face with today is large, and we wanted to take advantage of this.</p>

<h1>Why would you want it?</h1>
<p>There are two types of users who can use CrowdTrust. Firstly, there is the client, who is the person
who submits a task which needs answering. A client would want to join because they could receive
an accurate solution to a problem which they wanted solving. Also, in the future, when paying
the crowd is implemented, using CrowdTrust could be significantly cheaper than Mechanical Turk.
The second type of user are the crowd members. Crowd members would want to join because they
might have a passion for solving problems. With the scope of CrowdTrust, the types of problems
you solve is massively varied. As mentioned, eventually, the crowd would also be paid for solving
tasks, which would be a primary reason as to why someone would solve problems.</p>
